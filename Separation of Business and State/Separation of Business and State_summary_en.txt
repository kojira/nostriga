G Sovereignty, speaking at a conference, discusses his experiences with Nostra and his work on Nostra Rocket, which he has developed over the past year with support from a grant. He reflects on the concept of the separation of business and state, drawing on historical stories from his grandfather and insights from a professor in China, linking them to the modern state’s control over the economy through violence and regulation.

He argues that the state captures economic relationships and suggests that Bitcoin can create a parallel economy that is independent from state control. He emphasizes the need for the Bitcoin community to produce goods and services to reduce dependency on the fiat economy, thereby allowing them to dictate the currency used in transactions.

Sovereignty proposes a new approach to coordinating ventures that avoids traditional company structures, which he views as subservient to state control. Instead, he envisions a decentralized, self-custodial web of trust through Nostra, allowing individuals to collaborate without state interference.

He explains the merit-based system used to quantify contributions to projects like Nostra Rocket, and shares a live demonstration of how the venture operates. Sovereignty concludes by highlighting the importance of creating an economy that fosters human freedom and creativity, rather than relying on fiat systems, and calls for collective action to realize this vision.

He shares childhood stories of communism from his grandfather and insights from an economics professor in China, emphasizing that state power primarily stems from capturing the economy rather than using violence.

He argues that while Bitcoin offers an alternative economic territory, it remains reliant on fiat imports, complicating the establishment of a Bitcoin-centric economy. He suggests that to achieve this, Bitcoiners must produce goods and services that can only be purchased with Bitcoin, instead of convincing existing producers to adopt it.

G proposes a new way to coordinate ventures using a self-custodial, non-custodial model that avoids state control and enables collaboration among sovereign individuals. He introduces Nostra, a framework for this coordination, which allows for solving problems collectively without being governed by the state. 

He demonstrates the merit-based system used in the Nostra framework, where contributions are valued and tracked, facilitating efficient collaboration on projects like Nostra Rocket. He concludes by urging the audience to move towards a non-fiat dependent economy that emphasizes human freedom and innovation.

In his talk at a conference, G Sovereignty discusses his experiences with Nostra and its implications for creating a parallel economy that promotes freedom, particularly through Bitcoin. He reflects on the historical context of state power, contrasting it with the present-day economy's capture by the state and financial entities. G argues that Bitcoin represents a new territory of freedom, distinct from the fiat economy, but emphasizes the need for Bitcoin proponents to produce goods and services within their economy to truly separate from the fiat system.

He critiques the reliance on traditional company structures, which he believes subjugate Bitcoin’s value proposition to state control. Instead, he advocates for a non-custodial coordination model that allows individuals to work together without the need for state oversight. G introduces Nosta as a tool for creating this self-sustaining, decentralized model, exemplified by a new venture called Nost Rocket, which aims to produce goods while maintaining independence from state regulation.

He highlights the importance of collaboration and problem-solving within this framework, suggesting that the direction of projects should emerge from shared goals rather than centralized authority. Ultimately, G Sovereignty calls for a shift towards an economy that values human freedom over fiat dependency, encouraging the use of Nostra to create a new type of commercial venture aligned with these principles.
